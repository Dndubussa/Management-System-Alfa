# Fix Vercel Deployment - Missing Environment Variables

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

Your Vercel deployment is missing the Supabase environment variables, so the deployed system can't connect to the database. This is why patients and price lookups don't appear on the deployed version.

## 🔧 **Solution: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

### **Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials**

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
   - **anon key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these two variables:

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://your-project-id.supabase.co` (your actual URL)
   - **Environment:** Production, Preview, Development

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`
   - **Value:** `your_anon_key_here` (your actual anon key)
   - **Environment:** Production, Preview, Development

### **Step 3: Redeploy Your Application**

After adding the environment variables:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## 🔍 **How to Verify the Fix**

### **Check Environment Variables in Vercel**
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Check that both variables are listed:
   - ✅ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - ✅ `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`

### **Test the Deployed Application**
1. Open your deployed Vercel URL
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for these messages:
   - ✅ "Supabase: Getting patients..."
   - ✅ "Supabase: Got patients: X"
   - ✅ "Supabase: Getting service prices..."
   - ✅ "Supabase: Got service prices: X"

### **Check Receptionist Dashboard**
1. Log in as a receptionist
2. Verify that:
   - ✅ Patient bills are visible
   - ✅ Insurance claims are visible
   - ✅ Price lookup shows services
   - ✅ Summary cards show actual data

## 🚨 **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Environment Variables Not Applied**
- **Solution:** Make sure to set environment to "Production" and "Preview"
- **Solution:** Redeploy after adding variables

### **Issue 2: Wrong Key Type**
- **Problem:** Using service_role key instead of anon key
- **Solution:** Use only the anon/public key for frontend

### **Issue 3: Variables Not Loading**
- **Problem:** Variables not prefixed with `VITE_`
- **Solution:** Ensure variables start with `VITE_` for Vite to expose them

## 📋 **Quick Fix Checklist**

- [ ] Get Supabase Project URL and anon key
- [ ] Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Add `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Set environment to Production, Preview, Development
- [ ] Redeploy the application
- [ ] Test the deployed application
- [ ] Verify data loading in browser console
- [ ] Check receptionist dashboard functionality

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**

1. **Deployed Application** will show:
   - ✅ All patients in the system
   - ✅ All service prices for lookup
   - ✅ Patient bills and insurance claims
   - ✅ Working search and filter functionality

2. **Browser Console** will show:
   - ✅ Successful Supabase connection messages
   - ✅ Data loading confirmations
   - ✅ No connection errors

3. **Receptionist Dashboard** will display:
   - ✅ Real patient data
   - ✅ Actual bills and claims
   - ✅ Functional price lookup
   - ✅ Working estimate generation

## ⚠️ **Security Notes**

- ✅ **Use anon key** for frontend (safe with Row Level Security)
- ❌ **Never use service_role key** in frontend (security risk)
- ✅ **Environment variables** are secure in Vercel
- ✅ **Row Level Security** protects your data
