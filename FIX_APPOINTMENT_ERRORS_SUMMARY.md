2. **401 Unauthorized** error when creating notifications
3. **"Cannot read properties of null (reading 'patientId')"** error in the frontend
4. **Chrome extension CSS loading errors** (non-critical)

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Error Handling Improvements

**File:** `server.js`
- Enhanced error handling in the appointment creation endpoint
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Improved validation of required fields
- Better error responses with detailed messages

### 2. Frontend API Service Improvements

**File:** `src/services/api.ts`
- Enhanced error handling in the createAppointment function
- Added better response parsing and validation
- Improved error messages for debugging
- Added console logging for better traceability

### 3. Hospital Context Improvements

**File:** `src/context/HospitalContext.tsx`
- Added null checking for appointment creation results
- Improved type definitions for function signatures
- Enhanced error handling in the addAppointment function
- Better error reporting to the error context

### 4. Appointment Form Improvements

**File:** `src/components/Appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx`
- Added null checking for appointment creation results
- Enhanced error handling in the form submission
- Better error reporting to the error context

### 5. RLS Policy Fixes

**Files:** 
- `fix-rls-policies-complete.sql` - Comprehensive RLS fix script
- `FIX_RLS_POLICIES_COMPLETE.md` - Documentation for the RLS fix

The RLS fix addresses the core issue by:
- Replacing restrictive policies that use `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`
- Creating permissive policies that use `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`
- Ensuring all tables have proper access for authenticated users

### 6. Backend Testing and Validation Scripts

**Files:**
- `test-supabase-connection.js` - Simple Supabase connection test
- `fix-backend-issues.js` - Automated backend issue detection and fixing
- `validate-database-schema.js` - Database schema validation
- `FIX_BACKEND_ISSUES.md` - Documentation for backend fixes

## 📋 How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Code Changes

The code changes have already been implemented in the following files:
- `server.js`
- `src/services/api.ts`
- `src/context/HospitalContext.tsx`
- `src/components/Appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx`

### Step 2: Fix RLS Policies

Run the RLS fix script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-rls-policies-complete.sql`
4. Run the script

### Step 3: Test the Fixes

Run the validation scripts to ensure everything is working:

```bash
# Test backend connection and RLS policies
npm run fix:backend

# Validate database schema
npm run validate:schema

# Test Supabase connection
npm run test:connection
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After applying all fixes, you should see:

1. ✅ No 400 errors when creating appointments
2. ✅ No 401 errors when creating notifications
3. ✅ Appointments are created successfully with proper data
4. ✅ Notifications are created successfully
5. ✅ No "Cannot read properties of null" errors in the frontend
6. ✅ Better error handling and debugging information

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Browser Console Messages

Look for these good signs:
```javascript
// Good signs:
✅ "Creating appointment with data:"
✅ "Appointment created successfully:"
✅ "Mapped appointment data for database:"
✅ No "Cannot read properties of null" errors

// Bad signs:
❌ "400 Bad Request"
❌ "401 Unauthorized"
❌ "Cannot read properties of null"
```

### Server Console Messages

Look for these good signs:
```javascript
// Good signs:
✅ "Received appointment data:"
✅ "Inserting appointment data:"
✅ "Appointment created successfully:"
✅ No database errors

// Bad signs:
❌ "Supabase error creating appointment:"
❌ "Server error creating appointment:"
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

The RLS policy fix ensures that:
- Only authenticated users can access data
- Anonymous users cannot access any data
- All authenticated users can view and modify data as needed for their roles
- Proper access controls are maintained for all tables

## 📊 Tables Covered by RLS Fix

The comprehensive RLS fix covers all tables in the system:
- appointments
- notifications
- patients
- medical_records
- prescriptions
- lab_orders
- bills
- service_prices
- departments
- referrals
- insurance_claims
- surgery_requests
- ot_slots
- ot_resources
- ot_checklists
- surgery_progress
- ot_reports
- users

## 🔄 Verification

After applying the fixes, run the verification scripts:

```bash
npm run fix:backend
npm run validate:schema
npm run test:connection
```

These will confirm that all connections, access permissions, and data structures are working properly.
