# Fix Triage Queue Issue

## Problem
After receptionists register patients, they don't appear in the nurse's "Triage Queue" sidebar navigation. Instead, they appear in "Triage & Vitals" selection.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Patient Registration**: Patients are correctly added to triage queue with `workflowStage: 'reception'`
2. **TriageQueue Component**: Correctly filters for `status: 'waiting'` and `workflowStage: 'reception'`
3. **Data Loading**: Patient queue data is loaded but may not be properly updated in context
4. **Navigation**: Two separate components exist:
   - `/triage-queue` - Shows patients waiting for triage
   - `/nurse-triage` - For recording vitals and triage

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed getPatientQueue in HospitalContext
- **Issue**: `getPatientQueue` was not updating the `patientQueue` state
- **Fix**: Added `setPatientQueue(queue)` to update context state

### 2. Added Debug Logging
- **TriageQueue Component**: Added console logging to track data flow
- **Context**: Added logging to see what data is being loaded

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Service Layer**: Improved error handling for queue operations
- **Component Level**: Better error reporting and user feedback

## Expected Workflow

### Patient Registration:
1. Receptionist registers patient
2. Patient added to queue with `workflowStage: 'reception'`
3. Notifications sent to nurses
4. Patient appears in nurse's "Triage Queue"

### Nurse Triage Process:
1. Nurse sees patient in "Triage Queue"
2. Nurse clicks "Start Triage"
3. Patient moved to "Triage & Vitals" page
4. Nurse records vitals and triage category
5. Patient moved to doctor queue

## Testing Steps

1. **Register New Patient**:
   - Go to Patients ‚Üí New Patient
   - Fill out registration form
   - Assign doctor
   - Complete registration

2. **Check Triage Queue**:
   - Login as nurse
   - Go to "Triage Queue" in sidebar
   - Verify patient appears in queue

3. **Start Triage**:
   - Click "Start Triage" on patient
   - Verify redirect to triage form
   - Record vitals and complete triage

4. **Check Doctor Queue**:
   - Login as assigned doctor
   - Go to "My Patients" or "Doctor Queue"
   - Verify patient appears for consultation

## Debug Information

### Console Logs to Check:
- `üîç TriageQueue - patientQueue from context:`
- `üîç TriageQueue - triagePatients filtered:`
- `üîç TriageQueue - Loaded queue data:`

### Database Verification:
- Check `patient_queue` table for new entries
- Verify `workflow_stage = 'reception'` and `status = 'waiting'`

## Files Modified

1. **src/context/HospitalContext.tsx**
   - Fixed `getPatientQueue` to update state
   - Added debug logging

2. **src/components/Nurse/TriageQueue.tsx**
   - Added debug logging
   - Enhanced error handling

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix with new patient registration
2. Verify triage queue shows patients correctly
3. Test complete triage workflow
4. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues
